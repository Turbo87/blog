Title: Flight Playback
author: Tobias Bieniek

Did you notice that new, little button in the map corner yet? We've used
the weekedn to add automatic flight playback to all your flights and live
tracks! It is far from feature complete, but it works quite well already in the
current state. Please use it and let us know if you notice any problems.

If you want to fast-forward during replay or go back to an interesting point in
your flight you just have to *click* on the barogram.
