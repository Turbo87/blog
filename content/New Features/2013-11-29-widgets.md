Title: Widgets

Does your club have a website? Do you have one yourself? Great! Now you can
use SkyLines embedded directly on that website.

By embedding a small piece of code into your website you will automatically
show the latest flights of you or your club on your own page. This is just
one of some more widgets that we have planned. If you have any issues with
that, please let us know!
